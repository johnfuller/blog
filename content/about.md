Hello, you have found the playground of John Fuller. I use this site to post about things which I feel are interesting and potentially impactful to my life. This site isn't about news or posting for the sake of posting. I'm not trying to be an influencer. There's maybe a handful of people who might be interested in what I post here. I really feel the things I post here are part of a tapestry of things which could have a direct impact on me.

Most days, I'm doing some combination of web development and business building. I have a lot of business ideas and not enough time to work on them. I'm particularly interested in the immense opportunity which the AI space presents. There is a lot of money being thrown at this tech, and the killer apps are still to come. It feels like the early days of the web, and we have a lot of work to do.

I also have an interest in "building in public" to show people what building looks like somewhat behind the scenes. I also love the idea of a build in public community. I'm looking for my people.

The domain name was picked up as sort of a joke.
