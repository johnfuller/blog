[From Zerohedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/google-turns-nuclear-power-power-its-data-centers)

The big tech companies are betting on nuclear. This will be an interesting development to check into. It has always been difficult to cut through the noise of nuclear vs renewable. Renewable energy people high high conviction and they make a lot of noise. Nuclear has no such champions, until now. Money talks, and it's talking to nuclear.

The greatest argument I see against nuclear is that it's too expensive to compete with solar. However, cost of power isn't as much of a concern when it's standing between you and billions of dollars in investments into AI. I'm guessing this is a diversity play. The big tech players will take power wherever they can get it. And apparently they are finding some potentially easy pickings for nuclear.
