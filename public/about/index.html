			<p>Hello, you have found the playground of John Fuller. I use this site to post about things which I feel are interesting and potentially impactful to my life. This site isn&rsquo;t about news or posting for the sake of posting. I&rsquo;m not trying to be an influencer. There&rsquo;s maybe a handful of people who might be interested in what I post here. I really feel the things I post here are part of a tapestry of things which could have a direct impact on me.</p>
<p>Most days, I&rsquo;m doing some combination of web development and business building. I have a lot of business ideas and not enough time to work on them. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in the immense opportunity which the AI space presents. There is a lot of money being thrown at this tech, and the killer apps are still to come. It feels like the early days of the web, and we have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>I also have an interest in &ldquo;building in public&rdquo; to show people what building looks like somewhat behind the scenes. I also love the idea of a build in public community. I&rsquo;m looking for my people.</p>
<p>The domain name was picked up as sort of a joke.</p>
