      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post for anyone interested in following along with what I have been&#xA;doing. This has been pinging around in the my head as a necessary update to&#xA;family for months. Sorry about going off the radar, and here is an update on&#xA;what I have been up to and where I&amp;rsquo;m going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of 2024 has been a disaster. Earlier in the year I built excitement for a&#xA;business idea for a sports cards market place. The idea is that no current&#xA;market exists which is serving the community of collectors / investors. Tere are&#xA;options from companies from my child-hood who are stuck in the past. There are&#xA;options from hobbyist who haven&amp;rsquo;t created a serious offering. Finally, there are&#xA;markets that don&amp;rsquo;t cater to the sports fans (Ebay.) Much activity happens in the&#xA;walled gardens of Facebook, and that&amp;rsquo;s a clear indicator of a market ready to be&#xA;served.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
