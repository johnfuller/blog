      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post for anyone interested in following along with what I have been&#xA;doing. This has been pinging around in the my head as a necessary update to&#xA;family for months. Sorry about going off the radar, and here is an update on&#xA;what I have been up to and where I&amp;rsquo;m going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of 2024 has been a disaster. Earlier in the year I built excitement for a&#xA;business idea for a sports cards market place. The idea is that no current&#xA;market exists which is serving the community of collectors / investors. Tere are&#xA;options from companies from my child-hood who are stuck in the past. There are&#xA;options from hobbyist who haven&amp;rsquo;t created a serious offering. Finally, there are&#xA;markets that don&amp;rsquo;t cater to the sports fans (Ebay.) Much activity happens in the&#xA;walled gardens of Facebook, and that&amp;rsquo;s a clear indicator of a market ready to be&#xA;served.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see people claiming these models can reason all over social media. Watch out for motives. The companies who create these things are tryinging to sell you their service. It&amp;rsquo;s the same for those who are attracting eyeballs or selling themselves as experts. It&amp;rsquo;s important to know the capabilities of these models if you&amp;rsquo;re going to put them to serious use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;13/ Overall, we found no evidence of formal reasoning in language models including open-source models like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Llama?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Llama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Phi?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Phi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gemma?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Gemma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mistral?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Mistral&lt;/a&gt; and leading closed models, including the recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenAI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#GPT&lt;/a&gt;-4o and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/o1?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#o1&lt;/a&gt;-series. Their behavior is better explained by sophisticatedâ€¦&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mehrdad Farajtabar (@MFarajtabar) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MFarajtabar/status/1844456913616167009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;October 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</description>

      <title>Going Nuclear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/google-turns-nuclear-power-power-its-data-centers&#34;&gt;From Zerohedge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big tech companies are betting on nuclear. This will be an interesting development to check into. It has always been difficult to cut through the noise of nuclear vs renewable. Renewable energy people high high conviction and they make a lot of noise. Nuclear has no such champions, until now. Money talks, and it&amp;rsquo;s talking to nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The greatest argument I see against nuclear is that it&amp;rsquo;s too expensive to compete with solar. However, cost of power isn&amp;rsquo;t as much of a concern when it&amp;rsquo;s standing between you and billions of dollars in investments into AI. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing this is a diversity play. The big tech players will take power wherever they can get it. And apparently they are finding some potentially easy pickings for nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
